                <ul><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mq6LBQbGjk">Here's some fun facts about teeth:</a>
                </ul>
                  <li>The enamel on the top surface of your tooth is the hardest part of your entire body.</li>
                  <li>Teeth start to form even before you are born, baby teeth erupt when the child is between 6-12 months old.</li>
                  <li>Humans use four different types of teeth (incisors, canine, premolars, and molars) to cut, tear and grind their food.</li>
                  <li>Humans have only two sets of teeth in their entire lifetime: baby teeth and permanent teeth.</li>
                  <li>No two people have the same set of teeth: your teeth are as unique as your fingerprint.</li>
                  <li>Your mouth produces over 25,000 quarts of saliva in a lifetime: that's enough to fill two swimming pools.</li>
                  <li>An average person spends 38.5 days brushing their teeth over their lifetime.</li>
                  <li>Many diseases are linked to your oral health, including heart disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes.</li>
                  <li>One third of your tooth is underneath your gums: that means only two thirds of your tooth's length is visible.</li>
                  <li>If you get your tooth knocked out, put it in milk or hold it in your mouth, then get to the dentist immediately!</li>
