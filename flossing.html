            <p>For a healthy mouth and smile the ADA recommends you:</p>
              <p>Floss at least once a day, but not everyone knows the right way to do it.</p></div>

                 <ul><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DT0N3-hNFY">The proper flossing technique is:</a></ul>
                 <li>Break off about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around the middle finger of each hand. </li>
                 <li>Hold the floss tightly between your thumbs and forefingers.</li>
                 <li>Guide the floss between your teeth using a gentle rubbing motion. Never snap the floss into the gums.</li>
                 <li>When the floss reaches the gum line, curve it into a C shape against one tooth. Gently slide it into the space between the gum and the tooth.</li>
                 <li>Hold the floss tightly against the tooth. Gently rub the side of the tooth, moving the floss away from the gum with up and down motions.</li>
                 <li>Repeat this method on the rest of your teeth. Don't forget the back side of your last tooth. </li>
